# Hyperreal
Hyperreal is a project that aims to analyse a polish drug forum [with the same name](https://hyperreal.info/). It consists of three parts: a **"library"** that extracts important insights from the data, a **crawler** that provides the data and a simple **visual interface** that makes it easy to navigate the data.
